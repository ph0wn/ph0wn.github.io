    We expect all participants, sponsors, partners, friends, visitors and the Ph0wn staff to know and follow this Code of Conduct. These rules apply to the Ph0wn conference, CTF, workshops venues and related social events.

This includes a warning, expulsion from the event with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behavior to the local law enforcement.

<h2><i class="fas fa-minus-circle"></i> Anti-harassment</h2>
<div class="notice notice--danger">
    <p>
	Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of workshops, challenges or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>
    <p>
	As this is a security challenge, we would like to note that the <i>hacks created during the Capture the Flag contest or the badges submitted to the Badge Contest</i> are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
    </p>
    <p>
	Sponsors, partners and authorized visitors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise, create a sexualized environment. If you are being harassed or if you notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any member of Ph0wn staff immediately. Ph0wn staff will be willing to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
