<br>
For the very first time at ph0wn 2026, we are launching a <b>Creative
Contest</b>!
<br>
Come dressed up following the theme <b>“Flag Ship / Pirates”</b>
All participants will vote for the best costume, and the one receiving the most votes will win a <b>HydraBus</b>.
<br>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ul>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-receipt"></i> At the entrance of the Ph0wn CTF (March 14, 2026), every participant will receive <i>one</i> <b>vote token</b>.</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i> <b>Send your photo</b>  via Discord DM to BlackB0x, Cryptax, or Sandro before 11:30 (AM). Important: your photo must be taken on site, on the same day. Your costume should include no weapon whatsoever, no alcohol + comply to <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i> On the CTF interface, <b>link your vote token to your user account</b>. Beware, you can only use your vote token once, and it cannot be undone.</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> Voting opens at <b>12:00 and closes at 18:00</b>. You can change your vote any time you wish before 18:00. You may vote for yourself of course!</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-medal"></i> Winner collects his/her prize at 18:30.</li>
</ul>

The costume with the highest number of votes <b>wins the HydraBus</b>.


<h2>Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days"></i> Date: March 14, 2026. You must be wearing your <b>costume during the CTF</b>. Additionally, <i>costumes are welcome during the social event</i> (but that won't count for votes). </li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-camera"></i> Take <b>one (1) photo of yourself in costume on the CTF venue</b>. It must be <b>clearly taken on site, at Ph0wn's venue and on the day of Ph0wn CTF. No photo from home or your favorite hiking spot etc</b>. As a consequence, <i>remote participation</i> <i class="fa-solid fa-earth"></i> is forbidden, you must be on site.</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-paintbrush"></i> Photo editions: basically, you may edit your photo <i>a little</i> if your photo skills are poor, but <b>you must look exactly like on the photo</b>. For example, it is permitted to remove someone in background, adjust light etc. It is <i>not</i> permitted to add a fictional character, text, images, beard, black eye, modify your smile etc.</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"></i> Your photo and costume <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>. Ph0wn organizers reserve the right to disqualify any submission which might be improper. Actually, if your costume does not comply to the Code of Conduct, you will not be allowed to enter the venue, but we hope it does not come to that! The contest is meant to be fun!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-solid fa-gun"></i> <b>No weapons, even fake ones, and no alcohol</b>. Security will deny access...</li>
  <li><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> It's <i>your</i> photo. <b>We will not post your photo anywhere without your permission, except on the Ph0wn CTF interface</b>. We will probably take pictures of some of you, and post them on our website or social networks, <i>but not without your explicit consent</i>.</li>
<li><i class="fa-solid fa-comment-dots"></i> You are free to post any photo of you and your costume on social networks any time you wish (photos are yours!), but we advise you not to do so before the day of the CTF, if you don't want copy cats.</li>
</ul>
