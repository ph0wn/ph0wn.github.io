<h1>Prize Attribution</h1>

<h2>for Ph0wn CTF</h2>
<div class="notice">
  <i>This is a short explanation of how prizes are attributed.</i>
  <br />
  <br />
  At the end of the CTF, on Ph0wn's CTF scoreboard, the 3 teams with the highest score are identified and are entitled to a prize.
  In case the score is equal, the first team to reach the score is considered as first.
  <br />

  <ul>
  <li>The first team is called to select 5 prizes among a pool of available prizes.</li>
  <li>Then, the second team is called to select 5 prizes among the remaining prizes.</li>
  <li>Finally, the third team is called to select 5 prizes among the remaining prizes.</li>
  <li>If a team has less than 5 members, they still select 5 prizes :)</li>
  </ul>
  <br />

  Prizes at Ph0wn are provided by our <b>sponsors</b>. Many thanks to them!
  <br />
  In case of insufficient prizes, those rules are subject to change.

<h2>for the Teaser</h2>

<div class="notice">
  Prizes are different each year. They usually range from goodies to small prizes, with sole intent to congratulate and motivate participants.
  <br />
  <br>
  To receive a prize, you must be the <b>first</b> to submit a write-up for the given challenge (only 1 prize per challenge). Acceptable write-ups must be written in English and use standard Markdown, with images in JPG or PNG format. Your write-up should clearly describe all the steps required to solve the challenge, especially any tricky parts, and explain the reasoning behind each decision. The first winner may choose a prize, and subsequent winners will select from the remaining items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Your write-up will be published in the next Ph0wn Mag issue.
  <br>
  Additionally, Ph0wn el1te hacker T-shirts will be distributed to:

  <ul>
    <li>the 4 who got a prize for their write-ups (see above)</li>
    <li>the first 5 to finish all 4 challenges of FrangiPh0wn</li>
  </ul>
