<h2>Prize Attribution for the CTF</h2>
<div class="notice">
  <i>This is a short explanation of how prizes are attributed.</i>
  <br />
  <br />
  At the end of the CTF, on Ph0wn's CTF scoreboard, the 3 teams with the highest score are identified and are entitled to a prize.
  In case the score is equal, the first team to reach the score is considered as first.
  <br />

  <ul>
  <li>The first team is called to select 5 prizes among a pool of available prizes.</li>
  <li>Then, the second team is called to select 5 prizes among the remaining prizes.</li>
  <li>Finally, the third team is called to select 5 prizes among the remaining prizes.</li>
  <li>If a team has less than 5 members, they still select 5 prizes :)</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <br />
  In case of insufficient prizes, those rules are subject to change.
