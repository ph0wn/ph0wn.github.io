      <b>Ph0wn</b> (pronouce like *phone*) is dedicated to smart devices. Our CTF and Workshops are consequently connected (sometimes a bit loosely!) to smart devices. 
      For example, we had CTF challenges on connected coffee machines, drones and satellites, and Workshops on Ghidra for ARM, Hydrabus.

    <p>
      If you have already played CTFs, Ph0wn CTF has less Web challenges, less x86, but more ARM, embedded devices (e.g ESP32, Micropython, MQTT, Bluetooth...). <a href="https://github.com/ph0wn/writeups/tree/master">See our write-up repository</a> for examples.
