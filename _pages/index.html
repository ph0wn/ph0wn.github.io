      <b>Ph0wn</b> (pronouce like *phone*) is dedicated to <i>smart devices</i>.
      Our CTF and Workshops are consequently related to hacking smart devices, with <b>low-level software challenges</b>.
      Our goal is to have participants <i>interact</i> with equipment (e.g. download firmware, connect to serial port, communication with Bluetooth...) and use typical platforms for embedded devices (ARM, Micropython, MQTT, ESP32...).
      Some of our best examples:
      <ul>
	<li>Ph0wn 2017: make a Parrot drone to take off without the app.</li>
	<li>Ph0wn 2018: find the flag on a custom watch face for the Amazfit Bip.</li>
	<li>Ph0wn 2019: add a functionality to a connected Nespresso machine.</li>
	<li>Ph0wn 2022: hack a connected jump rope.</li>
	<li>Ph0wn 2023: communicate with the EchoStar XXI satellite.</li>
	<li>Ph0wn 2024: fix vulnerabilities of an app for M5 Stick C.</li>
      </ul>

      Each year, while less numerous, we also strive to create Android, retro-gaming, hardware, OSINT and programming challenges.

      If you have already played CTFs, Ph0wn CTF has less Web challenges, less x86, but more ARM, embedded devices (e.g ESP32, Micropython, MQTT, Bluetooth...). <a href="https://github.com/ph0wn/writeups/tree/master">See our write-up repository</a> for examples.
