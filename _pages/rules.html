	Sponsors, partners and authorized visitors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise, create a sexualized environment. If you are being harassed or if you notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any member of Ph0wn staff immediately. Ph0wn staff will be willing to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
