<h2>Equipment</h2>
<div class="notice">
  Participants should come with:

  <ul>
  <li>A computer and its power cord, including power adapters if necessary</li>
  <li>A variety of USB cables, including USB to Micro USB cable and USB to USB-C cable</li>
  <li>A multiplug outlet</li>
  <li>Wifi dongle (if not supported by laptop)</li>
  </ul>

  Highly recommended in the team:

  <ul>
  <li>A smartphone</li>
  <li>Bluetooth dongle (if not supported by your laptop)</li>
  <li>Bus Pirate, Hydrabus, CH341</li>
  <li>Soldering iron, flux, microscope, hot air station</li>
  <li>Docker, Kali, Exegol</li>
  
  </ul>

  We may be able to <i>lend</i> some equipment above, but it's better to bring your own.

  Participants are free to use any software or equipment of their choice (e.g. disassembler, Kali, virtual machines, SD card, proxmark...) provided it does not damage the target (see <a href="/rules/">rules</a>). Ask organizers if you are in doubt.
